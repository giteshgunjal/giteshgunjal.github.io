I am an engineer who loves learn, solve problems and play with robots. Currently I am part of the Robotics and Optimization for the Analysis of Human Motion ([ROAHM](http://www.roahmlab.com/)) Lab advised by [Prof. Ram Vasudevan](http://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal), and am working on perception, including mapping, localization and system identification, with applications for safe motion planning and control.

I earned my [Masters in Robotics](https://robotics.umich.edu/) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. During my masters I explored different fundamental facets of robotics, and was thrilled to understand and notice how they were linked with each other. I explored Motion planning, Controls, Optimiation and Mobile Robotics. It is interesting for me to see how probability and uncertainty played a important role in perception, planning and control, and am currently pursuing my research in the field. 

My current research interests include Perception, Mapping and Planning.

Prior to that, I earned my B.Tech in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.vit.edu/Mechanical/) from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India. During my undergraduate years, I was part of a formula student team [Veloce Racing](https://www.linkedin.com/company/team-veloce-racing/?originalSubdomain=in), where we used to build formula style racecars and won various national level competitions.
